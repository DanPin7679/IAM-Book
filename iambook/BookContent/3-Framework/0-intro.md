## Roles and responsabilities

As stated in introduction, most classification focus on the software and or model level, we will look at the user perspective. For we will formalize what we believe should be the role and responsabiities of the different contributor to the modelling process. We understand that this is based on our own judgement for most part of the structure, but in a context of formal fiduaciry user (exemple, pension plan, goverment), the role of the user is normally really well defined and logally enforced.
