# Modelling Process

## Roles and responsabilities

As stated in introduction, most classification focus on the software and or model level, we will look at the user perspective. For we will formalize what we believe should be the role and responsabiities of the different contributor to the modelling process. We understand that this is based on our own judgement for most part of the structure, but in a context of formal fiduaciry user (exemple, pension plan, goverment), the role of the user is normally really well defined and logally enforced.

## Layers of Abstraction

When trying to answer a question through system modelling, the implementation details should not influence the problem. The relation must be the other way around. The problem influence the system boundaries, which influence the model, which influence the implementation details.

In practice though, because many problem are untrackable, a two ways influence relationship exit between the model and the implementation details. This relationship take the form of a compromise between complexity of the model and trackability of the implementation details.

That being said, what is possible should still not influence the question and the problem definition.

### Problem Definition and Goal

#### Question

### Conceptual Components

#### System

To assess the energy and economic systems within which we reside, a conceptual or philosophical framework can help us figure out if we are doing a good job. Are we assuming too much? Are we constraining ourselves to a limited set of explanations without realizing it? One such framework is naturalism.
Sean Carroll, in The Big Picture, describes naturalism as considering:13

1. There is only one world, the natural world.
2. The world evolves according to unbroken patterns, the laws of nature. 3. The only reliable way of learning about the world is by observing it.

Importantly, the combinations of matter, energy, and information do not answer “why” or “should” questions. “Why does the widget exist?” “Should the widget exist?” We could go further to ask questions such as “Why do we exist?” and “What is the purpose of life?”

Each system is defined by the boundaries that distinguish it from everything else. Some elements are within the system, and some are not. Think of systems residing within other systems as a set of Russian Matryoshka dolls where each doll nests within a larger doll. An energy and economic narrative could discuss a small or large boundary just like you could play with one of the small or large Matryoshka dolls.
