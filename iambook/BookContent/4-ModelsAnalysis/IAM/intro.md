# Integrated Assessment Model (IAM)

Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are simplified representations of complex physical and social systems, focusing on the interaction between economy, society and the environment. IAMs aim to provide policy-relevant insights into global environmental change and sustainable development issues by providing a quantitative description of key processes in the human and earth systems and their interactions. Human societies interact with their natural environment in numerous ways. They extract services and resources, shape the natural environment according to their needs and cause impacts by emissions, disturbance and waste. This can cause severe environmental degradation with possible feedbacks to the human system. Hence, there is a strong need to analyse different development patterns as done in using IAMs. The modelling is integrated, i.e. it uses information from many scientific disciplines and describes both the human and earth system. The term assessment refers to focus on generating useful information for decision-making, even in case of large uncertainties.

IAMs capture human-society interactions by describing them as coupled systems on the relevant geographical and intertemporal scales for policy-making. Often these systems involve the interactions between energy-land-economy and climate. For example, the assessment of strategies to limit global warming is conducted by IAMs with global coverage and a time horizon until the end of the 21st century. To understand future changes in the interaction between human society and the Earth system, and assess available management strategies, IAMs use scenario approaches that describe a range of outcomes under different courses of action and assumptions. Such scenarios are often based on narratives describing how society could develop, a set of trends in socio-economic drivers, policies, and technology developments, and in many cases societal goals to be achieved. IAMs translate such assumptions, trends and goals into quantitative projections. They typically include a description of human activity (e.g. energy and land use), direct drivers of environmental change (e.g. emissions, land use and resource use), resulting impacts (e.g. climate change and consequences for crop yields) and response options. The output of IAMs is a description of human-earth system coupling and development over the course of several decades.

The most common use of IAMs is in the field of climate mitigation. A key purpose of IAMs is to provide orientation knowledge for the deliberation of future climate action strategies by policymakers, civil society and the private sector. This is done by presenting different courses of actions (climate change and climate action pathways) towards a variety of long-term climate outcomes under a broad range of assumptions about future socio-economic, institutional and technological developments. The resulting climate change and climate action pathways can be analysed in terms of their outcomes towards a set of societal goals (such as the SDGs) and the resulting trade-offs between different pathways. Key trade-offs that have been investigated in the IAM literature are, for example, between (i) no, moderate, and ambitious mitigation pathways, (ii) early vs delayed mitigation action, and (iii) pathways with different emphasis on supply-side vs demand-side mitigation measures or more broadly different sustainable development strategies. Key uncertainties that were explored in the IAM literature are between (i) different socio-economic futures as, for example, represented by the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs), (ii) different technological developments and (iii) different resource potentials.

### Topic

While by far most IAMs are used for climate mitigation, similar models have also been developed for air pollution, water use and other topics. Moreover, IAMs are increasingly used to analyse sustainable development strategies (e.g. achievements of SDGs).

### Solution concept.

Simulation models are based on the evaluation of the dynamic behavior of a system. They can be used to determine the performance of a system under alternative assumptions.

On the other hand, optimization models seek to maximize or minimize a mathematical objective function under a set of constraints. Most often, the objective function represents the total cost or revenue of a given system or the total welfare of a given society. The set of constraints can be used to represent limitations on the system, such as: constraints on flows, resource and technology availability, labor and financial limitations. Specifically, when modelling climate mitigation responses, limiting carbon budgets is often used to represent future temperature level pathways.

### Temporal and spatial system boundaries

Global IAMs are used to analyze global emissions scenarios extrapolating current trends under a variety of assumptions and climate change action pathways under a variety of global goals. In recent years, a class of national and regional IAMs have emerged to study trends and transformation pathways in a given geography. They typically have higher sectoral, policy and technology resolution than global models and make assumptions about boundary conditions set by global markets and international policy regimes.

What does an
'optimal policy' mean?
An optimal policy covers aspects such as

1. when should I optimally invest in climate abatement?
2. how much should I invest in
   non-climate-abatement productive initiatives?
3. what is the optimal carbon tax...
