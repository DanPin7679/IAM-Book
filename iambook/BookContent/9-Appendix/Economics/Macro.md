# Macroeconomics

## Short Run

In the short run, demand determines output. Many factors affect demand, from consumer confidence to the state of the financial system, to fiscal and monetary policy.

## The Goods Market

- Changes in the demand for goods lead to changes in production.
- Changes in production lead to changes in income.
- Changes in income lead to changes in the demand for goods.

$Z \equiv C + I + G + X - IM$

where

- consumption (which we will denote by the letter C when we use algebra throughout this book). These are the goods and services purchased by con- sumers, ranging from food to airline tickets, to new cars, and so on. Consumption is by far the largest component of GDP. In 2014, it accounted for 68% of GDP.
- investment 1I2, sometimes called fixed investment to distinguish it from inventory investment (which we will discuss later). Investment is the sum of nonresidential investment, the purchase by firms of new plants or new ma- chines (from turbines to computers), and residential investment, the purchase by people of new houses or apartments.
- government spending: This represents the purchases of goods and services by the federal, state, and local governments. The goods range from airplanes to office equipment. The services include services provided by govern- ment employees: In effect, the national income accounts treat the government as buying the services provided by government employees—and then providing these services to the public, free of charge.
  The sum of lines 1, 2, and 3 gives the purchases of goods and services by U.S. consum- ers, U.S. firms, and the U.S. government. To determine the purchases of U.S. goods and services, two more steps are needed:
  First, we must add exports 1X2, the purchases of U.S. goods and services by foreigners.
  Second, we must subtract imports 1IM2 the purchases of foreign goods and services by U.S. consumers, U.S. firms, and the U.S. government.
  The difference between exports and imports is called net exports 1X - IM2, or the trade balance. If exports exceed imports, the country is said to run a trade b surplus. If exports are less than imports, the country is said to run a trade deficit. In 2014, U.S. exports accounted for 13.5% of GDP. U.S. imports were equal to 16.6% of GDP, so the United States was running a trade deficit equal to 3.1% of GDP.
  Exports 7 imports
  3 trade surplus
  Imports 7 exports
  3 trade deficit
  Although it is called ‘inventory investment’, the word invest- ment is slightly misleading. In contrast to fixed investment, which represents decisions by firms, inventory investment is partly involuntary, reflect- ing the fact that firms did not anticipate sales accurately in making production plans.
  Make sure you understand each of these three equivalent ways of stating the relations among production, sales, and inventory investment:
  Inventory investment = production - sales Production =
  sales + inventory investment Sales =
  Production - inventory investment
  ■■ So far we have looked at various sources of purchases (sales) of U.S. goods and services in 2014. To determine U.S. production in 2014, we need to take one last step:
  In any given year, production and sales need not be equal. Some of the goods produced in a given year are not sold in that year but in later years. And some of the goods sold in a given year may have been produced in a previous year. The difference between goods produced and goods sold in a given year—the difference between production and sales, in other words—is called inventory investment.

We now need to think about the determinants of Z. To make the task easier, let’s first make a number of simplifications:
■■ Assume that all firms produce the same good, which can then be used by consum- ers for consumption, by firms for investment, or by the government. With this (big) simplification, we need to look at only one market—the market for “the” good—and think about what determines supply and demand in that market.
■■ Assume that firms are willing to supply any amount of the good at a given price level P. This assumption allows us to focus on the role demand plays in the determination of output. As we shall see, this assumption is valid only in the short run. When we move to the study of the medium run (starting in Chapter 7), we shall abandon it. But for the moment, it will simplify our discussion.
■■ Assume that the economy is closed—that it does not trade with the rest of the world: Both exports and imports are zero. This assumption clearly goes against the facts: Modern economies trade with the rest of the world. Later on (starting in Chapter 17), we will abandon this assumption as well and look at what happens when the econ- omy is open. But, for the moment, this assumption will also simplify our discussion because we won’t have to think about what determines exports and imports.

Under the assumption that the economy is closed, $X = IM = 0$, so the demand for goods Z is simply the sum of consumption, investment, and government spending:

$$
Z\equiv C+I+G
$$

### Consumption

$C = C(Y_D) $

$C = c_0 + c_1 YD$

parameter c is called the propensity to consume.
parameter c0 has a literal interpretation. It is what people would consume if their disposable income in the current year were equal to zero

graph c function

Next we need to define disposable income YD . Disposable income is given by YD K Y - T

where Y is income and T is taxes paid minus government transfers received by consum- ers. For short, we will refer to T simply as taxes—but remember that it is equal to taxes minus transfers. Note that the equation is an identity, indicated by “K”.
Replacing YD in equation (3.2) gives
C=c +c1Y-T2

### Investment (I)

We will take investment as given and write:
$I = I$

### Government Spending (G)

we will take G and T as exogenous. But the reason why we assume G and T are exogenous is different from the reason we assumed investment is exogenous. It is based on two distinct arguments:
■■ First, governments do not behave with the same regularity as consumers or firms, so there is no reliable rule we could write for G or T corresponding to the rule we wrote, for example, for consumption. (This argument is not airtight, though. Even if gov- ernments do not follow simple behavioral rules as consumers do, a good part of their behavior is predictable. We will look at these issues later, in particular in Chapters 22 and 23. Until then, I shall set them aside.)
■■ Second, and more importantly, one of the tasks of macroeconomists is to think about the implications of alternative spending and tax decisions. We want to be able to say, “If the government was to choose these values for G and T, this is what would

### 3-3 Equilibrium Output

$Z=c +c1Y-T2+I+G$

Let’s now turn to equilibrium in the goods market, and the relation between pro- duction and demand. If firms hold inventories, then production need not be equal to demand: For example, firms can satisfy an increase in demand by drawing upon their inventories—by having negative inventory investment. They can respond to a decrease in demand by continuing to produce and accumulating inventories—by having positive inventory investment. Let’s first ignore this complication, though, and begin by assum- ing that firms do not hold inventories. In this case, inventory investment is always equal to zero, and equilibrium in the goods market requires that production Y be equal to the demand for goods Z:
$Y = Z$

so

$Y = c_0 + c_1 (Y - T) + I + G$

$Y= \frac{1}{1 - c_1} (c_0 + I + G - c_1 T)$

umber greater than one. For this reason, this 1
number, which multiplies autonomous spending, is called the multiplier

### Equilibrim Saving = Investment

Thus far, we have been thinking of equilibrium in the goods market in terms of the equality of the production and the demand for goods. An alternative—but, it turns out, equivalent—way of thinking about equilibrium focuses instead on investment and sav- ing. This is how John Maynard Keynes first articulated this model in 1936, in The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money.

$S \equiv Y_D - C$

Or, equivalently,

$I = S + (T - G)$

On the left is investment. On the right is saving, the sum of private saving and public
saving.
Equation (3.10) gives us another way of thinking about equilibrium in the goods market: It says that equilibrium in the goods market requires that investment equal saving—the sum of private and public saving. This way of looking at equilibrium explains why the equilibrium condition for the goods market is called the IS relation, which stands for “Investment equals Saving”: What firms want to invest must be equal to what people and the government want to save.

To summarize: There are two equivalent ways of stating the condition for equilib- rium in the goods market:
Production = Demand Investment = Saving

## Financial Markets I

### Demand for Money

$M^d = \$ Y  L_1$

where $Y denotes nominal income. Read this equation in the following way: The demand for money Md is equal to nominal income $Y times a decreasing function of the interest rate i, with the function denoted by L1i2

### Interest Rate: I

Suppose the central bank decides to supply an amount of money equal to M, so

$Ms = M$

Equilibrium in financial markets requires that money supply be equal to money de- mand, that Ms = Md. Then, using Ms = M, and equation (4.1) for money demand, the equilibrium condition is
Money supply = Money demand

$$
M = \$ Y L_1
$$

### Interest Rate with Bank

Now turn to the demand for reserves by banks. The larger the amount of checkable deposits, the larger the amount of reserves the banks must hold, both for precaution- ary and for regulatory reasons. Let u (the Greek lowercase letter theta) be the reserve ratio, the amount of reserves banks hold per dollar of checkable deposits. The demand for reserves by banks, call it H, is given by

$$
H^d = \theta M^d = \theta \$ Y L(i)
$$

The first equality reflects the fact that the demand for reserves is proportional to the demand for checkable deposits. The second equality reflects the fact that the demand for checkable deposits depends on nominal income and on the interest rate. So, the demand for central bank money, equivalent the demand for reserves by banks, is equal to u times the demand for money by people

The equilibrium condition is that the supply of central bank money be equal to the demand for central bank money:

$$
H = H^d
$$

$$
H = \theta \$ Y L(i)
$$

## Goods and Financial Markets: The IS-LM Model

We characterized equilibrium in the goods market as the condition that production, Y, be equal to the demand for goods, Z. We called this condition the IS relation.

### Investment, Sales, and the Interest Rate

This was for simplicity. Investment is in fact far from constant and depends primarily on two factors:

The level of sales. Consider a firm facing an increase in sales and needing to increase production. To do so, it may need to buy additional machines or build an additional plant. In other words, it needs to invest. A firm facing low sales will feel no such need and will spend little, if anything, on investment.
The interest rate. Consider a firm deciding whether or not to buy a new machine. Suppose that to buy the new machine, the firm must borrow. The higher the interest rate, the less attractive it is to borrow and buy the machine. (For the moment, and to keep things simple, we make two simplifications. First, we assume that all firms can borrow at the same interest rate—namely, the interest rate on bonds as determined in Chapter 4. In fact, many firms borrow from banks, possibly at a different rate. We also leave aside the distinction between the nominal interest rate—the interest rate in terms of dollars—and the real interest rate—the interest rate in terms of goods. We return to both issues in Chapter 6.) At a high enough interest rate, the additional profits from using the new machine will not cover interest payments, and the new machine will not be worth buying.

$$
I = I(Y, i)
$$

### Determining Output

An increase in output leads to an increase in investment. An increase in the interest rate leads to a decrease in investment.
Taking into account the investment relation (5.1), the condition for equilibrium in the
goods market becomes

$$
Y = C(Y - T) + I(Y, i) + G
$$

### Growth

So, when we focus on comparing standards of living, we get more meaningful com- parisons by correcting for the two effects we just discussed—variations in exchange rates and systematic differences in prices across countries. The details of constructing these differences are complicated, but the principle is simple. The numbers for GDP—and hence for GDP per person—are constructed using a common set of prices for all coun- tries. Such adjusted real GDP numbers, which you can think of as measures of pur- chasing power across time or across countries, are called purchasing power parity (PPP) numbers. Further discussion is given in the Focus box “The Construction of PPP Numbers.”
