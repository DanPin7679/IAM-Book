# Economics and climate

## Gaya Identity

$$
F = P (\frac{G}{P}) (\frac{E}{G}) (\frac{F}{E})
$$

where:

$$
F \\
P \\
G \\
E \\
$$

This simple formula help us understand the different way we can reduce our GHGs' emission.

### Population

### Per Capita Consumption

### Energy Intensity of GDB

### Emission Intensity of Energy

## Two paradigms

This interface is probably the biggest disagreement between the Economics School of thoughs.

- Decoupling not possible, only solution degrowth
- Decoupling possible through technology

This is a big problem since as w e will see, the solutions are completely different and are path dependants.

## Policies

### Adaptation

### Mitigation

## Planning Analysis

### Cost-Benefits

### Welfare Maximisation

### Cost Effectiveness
