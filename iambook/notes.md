## Beyond DICE: What the New-Generation Integrated Assessment Models Can Teach Us

1. using recursive utility functions;
2. allowing for possibility of tipping points;
3. allowing for uncertainty in economic growth, in the damage function and in the location of the tipping points;
4. allowing for Bayesian updating of information;
5. ensuring that we recover stylized investment facts (equities and fixed income);
6. allowing for (costly) negative emissions as well.

Under conditions of economic growth we expected future generations to be richer, and therefore their marginal utility of consumption lower.
This means that a future loss in consumption should give rise to a smaller loss in utility than the same consumption loss
today.
The more so, the higher the parameter n: the more we dislike uneven consumption, we more we want to push the abatement burden on our richer (grand)children.
From this one expects that a high n should suggest modest abatement efforts today: high abatement efforts today are seen from this perspective as a tax on the (current) poor to benefit the (future) rich.
However, if we look at the parameter n from the perspective of relative risk aversion, under conditions of uncertainty a high n should suggest that substantial resources should be spent today because of our aversion to static risk.

As Ackerman (2013) eloquently puts it
'these two interpretations of n might appear to parallel each other (...) (but they are actually on a collision course. (...)
With separable utility functions / there is no natural way to model a combination of strong risk aversion and strong future orientation'.
Not surprisingly, authors, such as Cline (1992) or Stern
(2007), who have chosen a very low value for n, and authors, such as Nordhaus (2007), who have chosen a higher value, have arrived at radically different policy recommendations.
