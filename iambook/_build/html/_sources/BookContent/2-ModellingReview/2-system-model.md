### System

Scientists came up with the concept of a system to help us understand the changes that occur around us and are affected by us. Here are two definitions.
. . . a system is a whole of some sort made up of interacting or interdependent elements or components integrally related among themselves in a way that differs from the relationships they may have with other elements.2—George Mobus and Michael Kalton (2015)
A system is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something (function or purpose).3—Donella Meadows (2008)

Thus, a system first has a number of parts, or elements. These parts are connected. Finally, these connected parts operate in a manner that is defined not only by the parts but also by the connections among the parts. These connections constrain the system to operate within a subset of all possible options that could exist with the same set of elements. We might then define the system as having a function or purpose that we cannot otherwise explain without the full present definition of a system.

The concept of a system is powerful because it says that a system can have properties or act in a way that cannot be determined solely by adding up how the individual parts operate.

Scientists use the term coarse-graining to describe a system that has so many interacting elements that it is not useful or practical to describe each element. Coarse-graining is similar to emergence, but more explicit. Emergence can be very qualitative. Coarse-graining describes mathematical descriptions of phenomena, including properties we can objectively measure. Coarse-grained concepts sum- marize actions ongoing at “fine-grained” or smaller scales. The trick is that many situations going on at the fine-grained scale might translate to a single description at the coarse-grained scale. This means that if I know a system’s coarse-grained description, I can’t generally tell you what is going on at the fine-grained level because there might be multiple possible fine-grained descriptions or theories that are compatible with the coarser description

As nicely stated by Sean Carroll: “You can understand the air as a fluid without knowing anything about its molecular composition, or even if there is a description in terms of particles at all

Purposes are deduced from behavior, not from rhetoric or stated goals.7—Donnella Meadows (2008) (emphasis added). The purpose of the economy is not defined by what people, including politicians, economists, and scientists, say they want to happen or what their models indicate should happen. The purpose of a system is defined by what actually happens.

The term system is so generic that there can be systems of systems, and to some this is another maddening feature, but also necessary. For example, there is one global economy composed of the economies of many countries. Each country’s economy has many subsectors, composed of individual businesses, all of which are possibly trying to preserve themselves by maximizing profit. In a capitalist system, each business or economic sector preserves itself partly by commanding increasing flows of money through them.
