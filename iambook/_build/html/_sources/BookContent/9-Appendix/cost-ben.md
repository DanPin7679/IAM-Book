# Cost-benefit IAMs

The first class comprises cost-benefit IAMs that fully integrate a stylised socio-economic model with a reduced-form climate model to simultaneously account for the costs of mitigation and the damages of global warming using highly aggregate cost functions derived from more detailed models. In the model context, these functions do not explicitly represent the underlying processes, but map mitigation efforts and climate change to costs. This closed-loop approach between climate and socio-economic systems enables cost-benefit analysis by balancing the cost of mitigation and the benefits of avoided climate damages. They are typically used to assess the social costs of carbon.

Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) of climate change are so called because they inte- grate two things. Scientific information about the effects of greenhouse gases on climate. Economic information about the impacts of climate on welfare, including the costs of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. So IAMs all share the defining trait that they incorporate knowledge from more than one field of study, although different models vary greatly with regard to their scope (Weyant et al., 1996).

I shall not discuss these other types of model here, as they are not designed to do the main thing that has marked out IAMs in the policy process, which is to estimate the mar- ginal impact of one more tonne of greenhouse gas emissions, specifically carbon dioxide. This is given the name of the social cost of CO2 (SCCO2), and is, in certain circumstances, the correct tax rate to be applied to all emissions of CO2 (Hepburn, 2006).

There are three IAMs of climate change. The Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy (DICE) model developed by Bill Nordhaus at Yale University, USA. The Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse Effect (PAGE) model, developed by the author, Chris Hope, at the University of Cambridge, UK. The Climate Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation and Distribution (FUND) model, developed by Richard Tol, now of Sussex University, UK. The vast majority of the independent impact and SCCO2 estimates that appear in the peer-reviewed literature are derived from these three models (Tol, 2008).

DICE integrated in an end-to-end fashion, the economics, carbon cycle, climate science, and impacts in a highly aggregated model that allowed a weighing of the costs and benefits of taking steps to slow greenhouse warming. It was mainly used to calculate an optimal emissions pathway and the associated price on CO2 emissions (Nordhaus, 1993).
PAGE included regional detail and expressed all the main inputs as probability distribu- tions so that the risks of climate change could more easily be appreciated (Hope et al., 1993).
FUND was originally set up to study the role of international capital transfers in climate policy, but it soon evolved into a test-bed for studying impacts of climate change in a dynamic context. It had more regional and sectoral detail than the other two models (Tol, 1997).

The PAGE model was the main input to the impact calculations in the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, commissioned by the UK Government in 2005 and published in 2007 (Stern, 2007). Although not the first economic report on climate change, the Stern Review is the most widely known and most influential report of its kind (Sterner and Persson, 2008). The authors of the Stern Review chose the PAGE model because of its comprehensive treatment of risk and uncertainty, and the ease of replacing default input assumptions with customized values (Dietz et al., 2007). The Stern review estimated a mean SCCO2 of $85 per tonne of CO2, in the year 2001 (year 2000 US dol- lars), a higher value than nearly all previous estimates.
The fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007 highlighted the impact and SCCO estimates from the three models in Chapter 20

of working group two, including the recently published estimates from the Stern review (Parry et al., 2007).
In the United States, an interagency working group was convened by the Council of Economic Advisers and the Office of Management and Budget in 2009â€“10 to design an SCCO2 modelling exercise and to develop estimates for use in rulemakings. The intera- gency group was composed of scientific and economic experts from the White House and federal agencies. The interagency group identified a variety of assumptions, which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) then used to estimate the SCCO2 using the three integrated assessment models, DICE, PAGE, and FUND.

## The discount Rate Debate

Our results are not only economically interesting, but also have important policy implications.
Cost-benefit analyses such as the one in the DICE model have often been criticized on several grounds:

1. sometimes for not taking into account of important aspects of welfare to which it is difficult to give a consumption value;
2. sometimes for focussing too much on the welfare of a representative (and homogeneous) agent, and therefore neglecting issues of inequality and distributive equity;
3. and at times because the choice of the appropriate discount factor is deemed to be 'impossibly difficult'. 2
   As a consequence, as important and influential a body as the IPCC has chosen not to make use of cost-benefit analysis ('Thus standard cost-benefit analyses become difficult to justify (IPCC, 2014a; Dietz et al., 2016) and are not used as an assessment tool in this report').
   (It is extremely difficult if not impossible to meaningfully estimate discount
   rate for future costs and benefits' - IPCC Chapter 1 page 76)
