# Environmental Economics

"The benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting.... So prompt and strong action is clearly warranted."
"Climate change is the greatest market failure the world has ever seen, and it interacts with other market imperfections.... A range of options exists to cut emissions; strong, deliberate policy action is required to motivate their take-up." [Stern Report]

## The Economic Approach

Two different types of economic analysis can be applied to increase our under- standing of the relationship between the economic system and the environment: Positive economics attempts to describe what is, what was, or what will be. Normative economics, by contrast, deals with what ought to be. Disagreements within positive economics can usually be resolved by an appeal to the facts. Normative dis- agreements, however, involve value judgments.
Both branches are useful.

## Property Rights

Property Rights and Efficient Market Allocations
The manner in which producers and consumers use environmental resources depends on the property rights governing those resources. In economics, property right refers to a bundle of entitlements defining the owner’s rights, privileges, and limitations for use of the resource. By examining such entitlements and how they affect human behavior, we will better understand how environmental problems arise from government and market allocations.

### Efficient Property Rights Structures

Let’s begin by describing the structure of property rights that could produce effi- cient allocations in a well-functioning market economy. An efficient structure has three main characteristics:

1. Exclusivity—Allbenefitsandcostsaccruedasaresultofowningandusingthe resources should accrue to the owner, and only to the owner, either directly or indirectly by sale to others.
2. Transferability—Allpropertyrightsshouldbetransferablefromoneownerto another in a voluntary exchange.
3. Enforceability—Property rights should be secure from involuntary seizure or encroachment by others.

### Scarcity Rent.

Most natural resource industries, however, do give rise to rent and, therefore, producer’s surplus is not eliminated by competition, even with free entry. This producer’s surplus, which persists in long-run competitive equilibrium, is called scarcity rent.

David Ricardo was the first economist to recognize the existence of scarcity rent.

## Externalities as a Source of Market Failure

Exclusivity is one of the chief characteristics of an efficient property rights structure. This characteristic is frequently violated in practice. One broad class of violations occurs when an agent making a decision does not bear all of the con- sequences of his or her action.

An externality exists whenever the welfare of some agent, either a firm or household, depends not only on his or her activities, but also on activities under the control of some other agent.

### Other Property Rights Regimes

Private property
State-property regimes
Common-property resources

Res nullius property resources, the main focus of this section, can be exploited on a first-come, first-served basis because no individual or group has the legal power to restrict access. Open-access resources, as we shall henceforth call them, have given rise to what has become known popularly as the “tragedy of the commons.”

Two characteristics of this formulation of the open-access allocation are worth noting: (1) In the presence of sufficient demand, unrestricted access will cause resources to be overexploited; (2) the scarcity rent is dissipated; no one is able to appropriate the rent, so it is lost.

Unlimited access destroys the incentive to conserve. A hunter who can preclude others from hunting his stock has an incentive to keep the herd at an efficient level. This restraint results in lower costs in the form of less time and effort expended to produce a given yield of bison. On the other hand, a hunter exploiting an open-access resource would not have an incentive to conserve because the potential additional economic surplus derived from self-restraint would, to some extent, be captured by other hunters who simply kept harvesting. Thus, unrestricted access to resources promotes an inefficient allocation.

### Public Goods

Public goods, defined as those that exhibit both consumption indivisibilities and nonexcludability, present a particularly complex category of environmental resources. Nonexcludability refers to a circumstance where, once the resource is provided, even those who fail to pay for it cannot be excluded from enjoying the benefits it confers. Consumption is said to be indivisible when one person’s consumption of a good does not diminish the amount available for others. Several common environmental resources are public goods,

Therefore, inefficiency results because each person is able to become a free rider on the other’s contribution. A free rider is someone who derives the value from a commodity without paying an efficient amount for its supply.

## An Efficient Role for Government

While the economic approach suggests that government action could well be used to restore efficiency, it also suggests that inefficiency is not a sufficient condition to justify government intervention. Any corrective mechanism involves transaction costs. If these transaction costs are high enough, and the surplus to be derived from correcting the inefficiency small enough, then it is best simply to live with the inefficiency.

# Cost-Benefit Analysis

## Normative Criteria for Decision Making

Normative choices can arise in two different contexts. In the first context we need simply to choose among options that have been predefined, while in the second we try to find the optimal choice among all the possible choices.

### Evaluating Predefined Options: Benefit–Cost Analysis

Economists suggest that actions have both benefits and costs. If the benefits exceed the costs, then the action is desirable. On the other hand, if the costs exceed the benefits, then the action is not desirable.
We can formalize this in the following way. Let B be the benefits from a proposed action and C be the costs. Our decision rule would then be
If B 7 C, support the action. Otherwise, oppose the action.1
As long as B and C are positive, a mathematically equivalent formulation would be If B/C 7 1, support the action.

In benefit–cost analysis, benefits are measured simply as the relevant area under the demand curve since the demand curve reflects consumers’ willingness to pay. Total costs are measured by the relevant area under the marginal cost curve.
It is important to stress that environmental services have costs even though they are produced without any human input. All costs should be measured as opportu- nity costs. As presented in Example 3.1, the opportunity cost for using resources in a new or an alternative way is the net benefit lost when specific environmental services are foregone in the conversion to the new use. The notion that it is costless to convert a forest to a new use is obviously wrong if valuable ecological or human services are lost in the process.

### Finding the Optimal Outcome

In the preceding section we examined how benefit–cost analysis can be used to evaluate the desirability of specific actions. In this section we want to examine how this approach can be used to identify “optimal” or best approaches.

### Relating Optimality to Efficiency

According to the normative choice criterion introduced earlier in this chapter, desirable outcomes are those where the benefits exceed the costs. It is therefore a logical next step to suggest that optimal polices are those that maximize net benefits (benefits–costs). The concept of static efficiency, or merely efficiency, was introduced in Chapter 2. An allocation of resources is said to satisfy the static efficiency criterion if the economic surplus from the use of those resources is maximized by that allocation. Notice that the net benefits area to be maximized in an “optimal outcome” for public policy is identical to the “economic surplus” that is maximized in an efficient allocation. Hence efficient outcomes are also optimal outcomes.
Let’s take a moment to show how this concept can be applied. Previously we asked whether an action that preserved four miles of river was worth doing (Figure 3.1). The answer was yes because the net benefits from that action were positive.
Static efficiency, however, requires us to ask a rather different question, namely, what is the optimal (or efficient) number of miles to be preserved?

The ethical basis for this criterion is derived from a concept called Pareto optimality, named after the Italian-born Swiss economist Vilfredo Pareto, who first proposed it around the turn of the twentieth century.
Allocations are said to be Pareto optimal if no other feasible allocation could benefit at least one person without any deleterious effects on some other person.
Allocations that do not satisfy this definition are suboptimal. Suboptimal allocations can always be rearranged so that some people can gain net benefits without the rearrangement causing anyone else to lose net benefits.
