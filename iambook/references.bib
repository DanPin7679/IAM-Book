	abstract = {Designing efficient policies to slow global warming requires an approach that combines economic tools with relations from the natural sciences. The dynamic integrated climate-economy (DICE) model presented here, an intertemporal general-equilibrium model of economic growth and climate change, can be used to investigate alternative approaches to slowing climate change. Evaluation of five policies suggests that a modest carbon tax would be an efficient approach to slow global warming, whereas rigid emissions- or climate-stabilization approaches would impose significant net economic costs.},

	abstract = {IAMs are usually divided into two categories: policy optimization IAMs and policy evaluation IAMs. Policy optimization IAMs search for the optimal policy. They can be split into three principal types: (i) Cost/benefit models which try to balance the costs and the benefits of climate policies, (ii) Target based models which simulate the effect of an efficient level of carbon abatement in the world economy, (3) Uncertainty based models which deal with decision making under conditions of uncertainty (Manne, Richels, 1992; Nordhaus, 1994). Many policy optimization models start with a market economy in which the regulatory instrument is a tax and then convert the model to an equivalent problem which finds the optimal emissions. Such models maximize the weighted sum of utilities where the weights are adjusted until individual budgets balance (which is equivalent to a Pareto Optimum (second welfare theorem)), or start with optimal emissions and convert the results into a tax. So optimization models are standardized and provide a description of the world, given the assumptions of the equivalence theorems. Policy evaluation IAMs are well-known as simulation models. They include deterministic projection models in which each input and output takes a single value, and stochastic projection models in which at least some inputs and outputs take a range of values. Policy evaluation models take actions by agents and governments as given, provided by policy proposals, assumption, observation and expert opinion. In this chapter, we propose to review 6 IAMs (World 3, DICE, IMAGE, MESSAGE, GEM-E3 and REMIND) to understand how these models are able to integrate Energy, Climate and Economics. We will resume their main results in a table to present goals, structure, policy evaluation, policy optimization, and dynamics associated with the models. We will identify the future challenges for research design and policy decisions.},
